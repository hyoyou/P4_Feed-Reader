# RSS Feed Reader, Test-Driven-Development

This application was provided as part of Project #4 of my Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The code for the web application was provided, and I completed the /spec/feedreader.js test file.

## Getting Started

Open index.html in browser to open feed reader. You can either copy the path into your browser or type 'open index.html' from your terminal after navigating into the correct directory. The tests for the application will run on the bottom of the page.
